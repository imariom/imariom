## 🧠 About Me

I’m a software developer with a strong background in **systems programming and enterprise software development**, focused on building **reliable, performant, production-grade systems**.

My experience spans low-level systems work, large-scale backend services, modern web applications, and cloud-native deployments. I’m currently expanding into **Machine Learning**, with an emphasis on **engineering ML-backed systems**, not just training models.

I value:
- Strong fundamentals and clean architecture
- Performance, reliability, and maintainability
- Pragmatic engineering over hype

## ✍️ Writing & Notes

I document what I learn and build:

- **[Engineering Blog](https://www.imariom.com/blog)** — systems, backend, and ML integration
- **[Technical Notes](https://www.imariom.com/notes)** — architecture, performance, and reliability
- **[Project Write-Ups](https://www.imariom.com/projects)** — design decisions and trade-offs

## 🎯 What I’m Looking For

Roles focused on:
- Backend or systems-heavy engineering
- Cloud-native, production environments
- Teams that value strong fundamentals and clean design

I’m especially interested in roles where **ML augments well-engineered software systems**.
